Query Parameterizer

This is a script that allows you to input a query and a set of parameters to format the query, and returns a parameterized version of the query. The parameterized query can then be easily used in a database application. Usage

Paste your query in the left text area.
Split the query from the parameters using ||.
Format the parameters according to the script and paste them after the split.
The output is automatically copied to your clipboard and also displayed in the right text area.
Requirements

This script uses JavaScript and is designed to run in a browser environment. Contributing
